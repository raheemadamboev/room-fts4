Jetpack Compose and Material 3 app that uses SQLite extension Full Text Search 4 on Room. Full Text Search (or FTS) is a search technique in which every word stored in a text document is compared against the given query to find matches. Its ability to search a large number of documents quickly has led to its wide adoption in search engines, word processors and databases. It also calculates best match ranking using matchinfo() from FTS function.
